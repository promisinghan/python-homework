# Unit 2 | Automate Your Day Job with Python

## Background
It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete two Python activities, PyBank and PyRamen. Both activities present a real-world situation in which your newfound Python skills will come in handy. These activities are far from easy, though, so expect some hard work ahead!

## Before You Begin


Create a new GitHub repo called python-homework. Then, clone it to your computer.


In your local git repository, create a directory for both of the Python activities. Use folder names that correspond to the activities: **PyBank** and **PyRamen**.


In each folder you just created, add a new file called main.ipynb. Remember that to create this file you will need to use JupyterLab to correctly generate the .ipynb file format. This will be the main notebook to run for each analysis.


Push the above changes to GitHub.
